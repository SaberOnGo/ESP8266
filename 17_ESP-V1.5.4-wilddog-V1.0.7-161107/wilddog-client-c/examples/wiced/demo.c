 * Description: This demo show you how to control an led through server. We will
 *              creat a led node and push it to server,then subscribe the led 
 *              node, so you can change led's value in the server to control 
 *              led's on and off.
 *                  
 *
 *
 * Usage: 
 *          1. Copy SDK to wiced IDE's <apps> folder, probable path may be 
 *                  <WICED-SDK\apps\wilddog_client_c>.
 *          2. In <wilddog_client_c\examples\wiced\wilddog_demo_config.h>:
 *
 *                  default TEST_URL is coap://<your appid>.wilddogio.com/[path]
 *                  , change <your appid> to your <appid>, which is the appid 
 *                  of the app you created, and path is the path(
 *                  node path) in the app. if the tree like followed , <1> is 
 *                  your appid, <a> and <a/b> are both path.
 *                  
 *                  after runing demo, your data tree in cloud would like that:
 *
 *                  1.wilddogio.com
 *                  |
 *                  + a
 *                    |
 *                    + b
 *                        |
 *                         +led1:1
 *
 *          3. Modify CLIENT_AP_SSID and CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE to the SSID you 
 *             want to connect in wilddog_demo_config.h.
 *
 *          4. Change DEMO_LED1 to the gpio which connect to your LED.
 *
 *          5. Create a target in <Make Target>(may be in the right corner) like
 *              this:
 *              wilddog_client_c.project.wiced-<yourboard> download run
 *              
 *              <yourboard> is the board type, like BCM943362WCD4, etc.
 *
 *          6. Connect your board with PC, double click this target you created,
 *             it will build and write to your board, and then you can control
 *             your led.
 *
